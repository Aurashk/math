[section:daubechies Daubechies Wavelets and Scaling Functions]

[h4 Synopsis]

    #include <boost/math/special_functions/daubechies_filters.hpp>

   namespace boost::math {

   template <typename Real, unsigned p>
   constexpr std::array<Real, 2*p> daubechies_scaling_filter();

   } // namespaces


Daubechies wavelets are a family of compactly supported functions indexed by an integer /p/ which have /p/ vanishing moments and an associated filter of length /2p/.
They are used in signal denoising, Galerkin methods for PDEs, and compression.

The canonical reference on these functions is Daubechies' monograph /Ten Lectures on Wavelets/,
which we attempt to follow here.

To get the (low-pass) scaling filter for the Daubechies wavelet with 3 vanishing moments, use

    auto h = boost::math::daubechies_scaling_filter<double, 3>();

Notational conventions for these filters seem not to exist.
Ambiguities include whether or not the filter is defined via convolution or dot product (which corresponds to reversing the array),
and the overall scaling.
/The filters in Boost.Math agree with Daubechies, Ten Lectures, Table 6.1./
This means that the elements sum to sqrt(2), and the filter is defined via a dot product.
